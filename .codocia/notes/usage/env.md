| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `RESTLOOP_MODEL` | required | `model` field of every request |
| `RESTLOOP_API_KEY` | empty | sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| `RESTLOOP_API_KEY_FILE` | unset | file holding the key instead, read and trimmed before every request, so another program can refresh a short-lived token |
| `RESTLOOP_BASE_URL` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `/chat/completions` (or `/responses`) is appended; a trailing `/` is ignored |
| `RESTLOOP_WIRE_API` | chat completions | `responses` uses the OpenAI Responses API; other values are ignored |
| `RESTLOOP_REASONING_EFFORT` | unset | e.g. `low`, sent as `reasoning_effort` (or `reasoning.effort`) |
| `RESTLOOP_TIMEOUT` | `120` | seconds a single command may run |
| `RESTLOOP_MAX_STEPS` | `100` | steps per task: one model reply and its commands (retries and overflow recovery stay within the step) |
| `RESTLOOP_DEADLINE` | unset | seconds for the whole task; see [[how-it-works]] |
| `RESTLOOP_LOG_USAGE` | unset | `1` logs the token usage of each model reply on stderr |
| `RESTLOOP_LAST_MESSAGE` | unset | file that receives the final reply |
| `RESTLOOP_SESSION` | unset | conversation file to resume and save |

Numbers that do not parse as an unsigned integer silently fall back to the default (`env_num`). `RESTLOOP_LOG_USAGE` must be exactly `1`; empty strings count as unset for the key file and the effort.
