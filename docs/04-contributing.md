# Building, releasing and contributing

<sub>**English** · [中文](zh/04-contributing.md)</sub>

`cargo build --release` produces `target/release/restloop`. The crate uses edition 2024 and `let` chains inside `if`, so it needs a toolchain where both are stable (Rust 1.88 or newer). The release profile optimises for size (`opt-level = "z"`, LTO, one codegen unit, `panic = "abort"`, stripped).

Tests live in `src/tests.rs` and run with `cargo test`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and the tests on macOS, Linux and Windows for every push to `main` and every pull request. Run the same three commands before opening one. A `docs` job on Linux checks out the full history (`fetch-depth: 0`, so cited commits resolve), installs Codocia 0.2 and runs `codocia check`, so stale docs or `README_CN.md` fail CI.

## What the tests cover

Unit tests pin: `too_long()` accepts recorded provider wordings and rejects near misses (an overlong `tool_call_id`, a 500, a network error); `drop_old_output()` halves until it returns 0; `trim_thinking()` spares the last two replies, empties `reasoning_content` and drops only `reasoning` items of `output_items`; `truncate()` keeps head and tail. `shell()` tests (every CI platform): the exit line with both streams, a timeout kill, a background `sleep 30 &` not blocking.

One end-to-end test drives `run()` against `serve()`, a local canned-reply server: a tool call, an overflow 400 and its retry, a session resume, a retried 200 without `choices`. Over the Responses API: the key file, output items sent back in order (only `message` and `function_call` items lose `id`), retried server and unavailable-plan failures, overflow recovery, failing at once on a used-up plan, content filter, invalid request or unreadable key file. Under a deadline: a server that hangs before or after its 200 headers, and repeated 500s, stop early with `deadline of`; a 400 is reported as usual; a passed deadline sends nothing. It alone touches `RESTLOOP_*`, clearing them and any `*_PROXY` first.

## Changing the loop

Conventions the history suggests:

- **Options are environment variables with the old behaviour as default.** Read numbers with `env_num` so an invalid value falls back to the default, and add the variable to the `--help` text in `main()` and to the README.
- **Keep the model-facing surface fixed** (see [Overview](01-overview.md)). Changes to `system_prompt()` or the tool schema should come with benchmark evidence.
- **Keep the prompt prefix stable.** Anything that rewrites earlier messages breaks provider prompt caching; RestLoop does it only when the provider reports an overflow. A threshold-based trim was removed after an A/B showed no benefit (`f09603f4`).
- **Keep the program in one file with two dependencies.** The program is `src/main.rs`; its tests live in `src/tests.rs`. Its size and readability are the point.

## How a release is made

Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` (prerelease tags do not match) runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. **build** compiles five targets: macOS arm64 and x86_64, Linux x86_64 and arm64 (static musl), Windows x86_64, named `restloop-<target>[.exe]`.
2. **release** writes `SHA256SUMS` plus one `.sha256` per binary and creates the GitHub release. It refuses to run if the release already exists: published binaries are never replaced, because the npm package pins their checksums. Re-run only failed jobs instead.
3. **homebrew** regenerates the `restloop` formula in `lhwzds/homebrew-tap` (needs the `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` secret) and commits only if it changed.
4. **npm**, also after **release**, stamps and publishes the npm package with trusted publishing; the npm package section below explains it.

Running the workflow by hand (`workflow_dispatch`) builds and checksums but publishes nothing, which makes it a dry run.

## The npm package

The npm package contains no binary. `npm/bin/restloop.js` looks up `"<platform> <arch>"` in `checksums.json`, and on first run downloads that asset from the `v<version>` GitHub release, verifies its SHA-256, and stores it next to itself (temporary file and rename). Later runs skip the download. Either way the launcher runs the binary, passing arguments and stdio through and returning its exit status.

A tag publishes the package from CI (`f76038cb`): after the GitHub release, the `npm` job runs `node npm/stamp.js X.Y.Z dist/SHA256SUMS`, which sets the package version and rewrites `checksums.json` for five platforms, then `npm publish --access public` from `npm/`. It uses npm trusted publishing (OIDC, `id-token: write`, npm 11.5.1 or later), so no npm token or secret is involved. Earlier releases were published by hand (`a21f7c21`).

The stamped `package.json` and `checksums.json` exist only on the runner and are never committed back, so the repository copies stay at the last manual stamp (0.3.0) and will lag the published version. At this commit `checksums.json` holds the five v0.3.0 entries: `darwin arm64`, `darwin x64`, `linux x64`, `linux arm64` (musl) and `win32 x64`.
